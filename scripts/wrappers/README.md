# Wrappers
Contains plugin implementations that extend the base set to satisfy particular use cases.

We recommend that custom code follow this pattern, or use inheritance from the base plugin, whenever possible. 
This aligns with [the open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle) and makes it 
easier to maintain and troubleshoot plugin code.
